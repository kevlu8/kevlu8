I'm Kevin Lu, a 17 year old developer from Arcadia, Los Angeles County, United States.

I know C, C++, Python, JS, Lua, and Intel Assembly.

Some of my best projects: [PZOJ](https://github.com/PZOJ/PZOJ), an online judge for competitive programming; and [PZChessBot](https://github.com/kevlu8/PZChessBot), a 3400-rated chess engine from scratch.

In my free time, I enjoy playing [chess](https://lichess.org/@/kevlu8), doing [competitive programming](https://dmoj.ca/user/kevlu8), listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1MDrLIsSs2ucCiVwX99rlW?si=ece07f5715e848d6), and listening to philosophical debates.

I speak: English/Mandarin (native), French (B2), Cantonese (A1), and I am learning Japanese and Russian.

I received distinction (top 25%) on the 2022 Canadian Computing Competition Junior division, with a score of 57/75.

I won group 1 on the 2023 Canadian Computing Competition Junior division, with a score of 75/75!
